# Goal: Preserve AI/SEO for human profiles and their JSON-LD schema,
# while minimizing enumeration signals and blocking private areas.

User-agent: *
# Allow public human profiles and associated schema
Allow: /p/
Allow: /api/profile/
Allow: /api/profile/*

# Block other internal/API routes and private areas
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /dashboard/
Disallow: /login
Disallow: /cancel
Disallow: /terms-old

# Intentionally no public Sitemap to avoid creating a direct URL inventory.
# (You can serve a restricted sitemap to trusted crawlers separately if desired.)
